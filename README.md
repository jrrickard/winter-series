This is a project to help manage registration data for the [PPRR](http://www.pprrun.org/) [Winter Series](http://www.pprrun.org/events/WinterSeries).


The project is implemented using VMware's distributed control plan framework, [Xenon](https://github.com/vmware/xenon). The project uses a mix of Xenon stateful services and a stateless orchestration service to provide a unified REST API. The user interface is implemented using Angular2.
